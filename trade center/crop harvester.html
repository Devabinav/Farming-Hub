                    <p><b>What is a Crop Harvester?</b> A crop harvester is a versatile agricultural machine used to efficiently harvest crops. It automates the process of cutting, threshing, and cleaning, saving time and labor in large-scale farming.
                        <br><b>Types:</b> There are various types of harvesters such as combine harvesters, forage harvesters, and sugarcane harvesters, each designed for specific crop types.
                        <br><b>Importance:</b> Crop harvesters are essential for modern farming, especially in large farms where manual harvesting would be impractical and time-consuming.
